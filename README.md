# The Quality of Wines and its Characteristics
## Synopsis
This report explores a dataset containg acid and ingredients, % of alcohol, and the quality of wine with 1599 rows. I explored the dataset in order to find out which factors affect positively or negatively, and which one does the most and the least.

I had struggle when I try to find more than 3 relationships, because all the variables seem independent. However yet I was successfully found what decides the quality of wines and how much it actually affects.

After exploring dataset, the correlation between the quality of wines and other factors are clear, being able to predict what the quality of a certain wine will be by looking up those factors. The most interesting fact is, if the percent of alcohol of a wine is lower than average, it is very likely rated as low quality.

It was able to get a good result from this dataset by using R, but I could get the better results if I had more data, as it had only 1599 rows. I would be able to get the better result if there was a variable about what the wine was made of, such as the type and origin of grapes and the county of manufacture.
